# üéÆ Dynamic Analysis with Emulation

## FirmAE

The FirmAE3 tool extends the capability of FIRMADYNE4 to allow for the emulation of more Ô¨Årmware by using various arbitrations for services and the QEMU hypervisor. The focus of the arbitrations is to allow the running of web services, as that is a common attack vector. The beauty of this approach is that you do not have to buy the hardware to test the Ô¨Årmware. This powerful approach allows for scaled testing in parallel. The authors of FirmAE had a success rate of 79.36 percent on 1,124 devices and found 12 new 0-days, 5 which is not bad at all.&#x20;

## Setting Up FirmAE

### Install Packages

```
sudo apt install build-essential git telnet
```

### Install FirmAE

```
git clone https://github.com/pr0v3rbs/FirmAE.git

cd FirmAE

./download.sh

./install.sh

./init.sh
```

## Emulating Firmware

First, using the run.sh script, check any Ô¨Årmware . This step will extract the image, get the architecture, infer the network conÔ¨Åg, and associate an ID in the database for the analysis (this may take a while, so be patient):

```
sudo -E ./run.sh -c <netgear> <firmware.zip>
```

### Run the Emulator with Debugging Enabled

```
sudo -E ./run.sh -d <netgear> <firmware.zip>

# Access the shell
2
```

### Reset the Database and Environment

```
psql -d postgres -U firmdyne -h 127.0.0.1 -q -c 'DROP DATABASE "firmware"'

sudo -u postgres createdb -O firmdyne firmware

sudo -u postgres psql -d firmware < ./database/schema

sudo rm -rf ./images/*.tar.gz

sudorm -rf scratch/
```



At this point, the Ô¨Årmware should be running on the preceding IP as a tap device. You should also be able to connect to this virtual interface from the machine on which you are running QEMU. From within the VM, open a web browser and try to connect to the inferred IP, as shown next. You may need to wait a minute for the web service to fully start after the emulator launches the Ô¨Årmware.
